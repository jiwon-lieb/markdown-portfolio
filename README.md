      <p>
        <strong>Hi, I'm Jiwon!</strong>  
        I'm a versatile technical writer with a passion for transforming complex concepts into clear, accessible content. 
        With a master's degree in interpretation and translation, I have honed my communication skills across Korean, English, German (C2), and French. 
        I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, Git (as you can see 😊) and foundational knowledge of Java, JavaScript, and Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having successfully transitioned between multiple industries, I have demonstrated my adaptability, self-sufficiency, and relentless pursuit of growth.
